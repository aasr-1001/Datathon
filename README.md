# Datathon
This repository contains data analysis, visualization, and machine learning insights generated during a Datathon event. The goal is to explore datasets, uncover trends, and develop predictive models to solve real-world challenges.

**Project Overview**
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning, processing, and visualizing datasets to identify key patterns.

2.Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for better model performance.

3.Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating predictive models using various algorithms.

4.Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to present insights effectively.

**Contents**
Datathon_EDA.ipynb → Data exploration and preprocessing steps.

models/ → Machine learning models and training scripts.

visualizations/ → Plots and graphs generated during analysis.

data/ → Processed and raw datasets used in the project.

**How to Use**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aasr-1001/Datathon.git
cd Datathon

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the Jupyter notebook for analysis:
jupyter notebook Datathon_EDA.ipynb

**Input & Output of Location Based Segmentation (where users can add their desired area and other features they are looking for in a house and our model tells the predicted price)**

**KeyFindings**
1. Our model predicts the future trends (SalePrice) using features.
2. It also recommends investors when to invest in a house and when to buy.
3. The model tells sustainability enthusiasts, by how much percent the entered house supports green house principles.
4. The model provides a map using folium and ammenties nearby (9km) and how it affects the estimated price.
5. It has an added functionality where users can add their desired area and other features they are looking for in a house and our model tells the predicted price [LOCATION WISE SEGMENTATION].
