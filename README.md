# Datathon
This repository contains data analysis, visualization, and machine learning insights generated during a Datathon event. The goal is to explore datasets, uncover trends, and develop predictive models to solve real-world challenges.

**Project Overview**
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning, processing, and visualizing datasets to identify key patterns.

2.Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for better model performance.

3.Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating predictive models using various algorithms.

4.Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to present insights effectively.

**Contents**
Datathon_EDA.ipynb → Data exploration and preprocessing steps.

models/ → Machine learning models and training scripts.

visualizations/ → Plots and graphs generated during analysis.

data/ → Processed and raw datasets used in the project.

**How to Use**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/aasr-1001/Datathon.git
cd Datathon

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the Jupyter notebook for analysis:
jupyter notebook Datathon_EDA.ipynb

**KeyFindings**

>Our model predicts the future trends (SalePrice) using features.
>It also recommends investors when to invest in a house and when to buy.
>The model tells sustainability enthusiasts, by how much percent the entered house supports green house principles.
>The model provides a map using folium and ammenties nearby (9km) and how it affects the estimated price.
>It has an added functionality where users can add their desired area and other features they are looking for in a house and our model tells the predicted price [LOCATION WISE SEGMENTATION].
